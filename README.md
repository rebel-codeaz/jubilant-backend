Learning ins and outs of backend development

Okay, I've been interested in backend from long time. Finally learning it. It is so FASCINATING...
I am following some udacity courses.

# 1. Client and Web Server Communication (I'll add notes later)

# 2. HTTP and Web Servers
    - you write web servers from scratch and know how each component holds together 
    - Hello server (just prints hello when a request is hit)
    - Echo server (little dynamic, prints whatever you pass as query param)
    - MessageBoard server (POST requests, shows all previous messages)
    - BookMark Server(urlShortner, stores all urls with shortnames)
    - JSON
    # Key Points to learn:
      - Headers are important and they vary with kind of requests.
      - You can send html forms as string to display in browser via a request
      - Content-type is set according to what you are gonna send to browser, and getting it wrong throws a TypeError
      - Write good error messages and print statements to understand the flow.
